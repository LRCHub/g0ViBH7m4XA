Living in a hollow place
Paint peeling off the wall
We're not gonna make it after all
Let's see you here
You never signed your name
And your walls are as blank as your face
Take a few steps
Pretend you are erased
But i still see you
If the world is still around for you to hear this
Now take a few steps back and turn around
Thats not the right attitude
You still have something to prove

Thats not the right attitude
You're still here
So high i have no space
And have already begun to fall
We're not gonna make it after all
You're still here
Your ideas all die
Its still not the right time
For you to call yourself up
Peace man thats not the right attitude
That puts me in a bad mood
