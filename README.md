```lrc
[00:23.47] When the world is on your shoulder
[00:27.12] Gotta straighten up your act and boogie down
[00:30.93] If you can't hang with the feeling
[00:34.94] Then there ain't no room for you, this part of town
[00:39.23] 'Cause we're the party people, night and day
[00:43.59] Livin' crazy, that's the only way
[01:00.09] 
[00:47.09] So tonight
[00:49.19] Gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
[00:53.06] An' just enjoy yourself
[00:55.26] Groove
[00:57.53] Let the madness in the music get to you
[01:00.94] Life ain't so bad at all
[01:04.45] If you live it off the wall
[01:17.95] 
[01:06.52] Life ain't so bad at all
[01:08.47] Live your life off the wall
[01:10.19] (Live your life off the wall)
[01:12.41] Live it off the wall
[01:22.41] 
[01:13.14] You can shout out all you want to
[01:17.30] 'Cause there ain't no sin an' folks all gettin' loud
[01:21.57] If you take the chance an' do it
[01:25.66] Then there ain't no one who's gonna put you down
[01:29.57] 'Cause we're the party people, night an' day
[01:34.07] Livin' crazy that's the only way
[01:50.07] 
[01:37.53] So tonight
[01:39.60] Gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
[01:43.53] An' just enjoy yourself
[01:46.00] Step on and groove
[01:48.02] Let the madness in the music get to you
[02:07.52] 
[01:51.33] Life ain't so bad at all
[01:55.04] If you live it off the wall
[01:57.44] Life ain't so bad at all
[01:58.61] Live your life off the wall
[02:00.67] (Live your life off the wall)
[02:03.08] Live it off the wall
[02:13.08] 
[02:04.66] Do what you want to do
[02:08.29] There ain't no rules, it's up to you
[02:10.57] (Ain't no rules, it's up to you)
[02:12.45] It's time to come alive
[02:16.39] And party on right through the night (all right)
[02:40.39] 
[02:20.24] Gotta hide your inhibitions
[02:24.42] Gotta let that fool loose, deep inside your soul
[02:28.12] Wanna see an exhibition
[02:32.38] Better do it now before you get too old
[02:36.18] 'Cause we're the party people, night and day
[02:41.44] Livin' crazy that's the only way
[02:44.46] So tonight
[02:46.65] Gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
[02:49.94] And just enjoy yourself
[03:01.44] 
[02:52.90] C'mon and groove
[02:54.66] Let the madness in the music get to you
[02:58.31] Life ain't so bad at all
[03:02.07] If you live it off the wall
[03:03.53] (Life ain't so bad at all)
[03:06.28] Live it off the wall
[03:07.31] (Live your life off the wall)

[03:20.96] Let the madness in the music get to you
[03:24.55] Life ain't so bad at all
[03:27.91] If you livin' off the wall
[03:40.91]
